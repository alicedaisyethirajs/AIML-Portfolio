**Predictive Maintainance of Water Pumps** - ([https://github.com/alicedaisyethirajs/Predictive-Maintainance-of-Water-pumps])

Predictive maintenance is a crucial aspect of monitoring and maintaining systems like HVAC pumps. By using sensor data, it is possible to predict failures and schedule maintenance in advance, preventing costly repairs and downtime. This project aims to build a predictive maintenance model for HVAC pumps using machine learning techniques on sensor data to predict the machine's operational status. The dataset used contains sensor data from HVAC pumps, including readings from various sensors (sensor_00 to sensor_51) and a label indicating whether the machine is operating normally or requires maintenance.

**Content Based Movie Recommendation System** - ({https://github.com/alicedaisyethirajs/Movie-Recommendation-System)]

This is a simple Movie Recommendation System built using Python. It uses natural language processing techniques to analyze movie metadata and suggest similar movies to users. The core logic is based on string similarity (difflib) and content-based filtering using cosine similarity.
